My friends and I usually catch up over discord while playing online games such as Codenames, Chess, Poker etc etc. During one of these late night catch-ups, someone suggested that we play “Name, Place, Animal, Thing” — a multiplayer game we used to play in our middle school notebooks. For those unfamiliar with the rules, here’s a watered down version — the game lasts over multiple rounds, and at the beginning of each round, you get an alphabet. You then have 60 seconds to think of a “Name”, a “Place”, an “Animal” and a “Thing” — and note down words for each of those categories, but only words that begin with that letter. The person who gets the most correct answers over the course of the game wins. Easy enough!

Except, I couldn’t find an online version! Now what do I do? I decided to build it!
